This Project is one to test my mathematical skills and how I am able to implement them into an automated sudoku solver. This works through trial and error in the way that if an error occurred then it will go back a step and try again. It will continually do this until it gets the correct answer even if it means going all the way back to the start. This Sudoku Solver Project was one that was set as one of five projects that was part of the Quality Assurance Projects Certificate in Free Code Camp. Another part of this project was to see if I could work with unit tests and functional tests. You can find my original project on my repl.it https://repl.it/@JamesWatson7/boilerplate-project-sudoku-solver-1 as this is where i originally made the project. This also contains the Unit and Functional tests unlike this  one i have uploaded to GitHub
